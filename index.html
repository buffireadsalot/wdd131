                    <p>My name is Annela Buffin, and I live in Angier (Ann-jer), North Carolina, about 15 miles south of Raleigh. I have two children, both are grown and living their lives. My youngest is moving to North Carolina this year and I am looking forward to them coming out here! I have a passion for learning and exploring new technologies, especially as it is tied to healthcare. In my free time, I enjoy reading, and spending time with my dogs. I am also looking into growing a business through geneaology research. It is something I love and I am excited to see how I can help my family in their search for their ancestors and others!</p>

                <p>North Carolina is one of the most beautiful states I have lived in, and I have lived and visited all over. I love it for the gorgeous trees, wildlife, torrential rain storms, and the quiet of the evenings when all you can hear are the frogs singing. The state is full of places to navigate and you don't have to drive more than 20 minutes in any direction to be surrounded by rivers like the Cape Fear River in the photo. The number one export from North Carolina are sweet potatoes! Their strawberries rival my native California strawberries and even surpass them. </p>
